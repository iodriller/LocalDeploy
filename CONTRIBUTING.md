# Contributing

This project is intentionally small and local-first. Keep changes focused on safe local inference, straightforward cross-platform setup, and compatibility with local HTTP clients.

## Local Checks

From the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\smoke_test.ps1
python -m ruff check .
pytest -q
node --test tests/js/frontend-modules.test.mjs
```

Install an editable development checkout with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`. Runtime pins live
in `requirements.txt` and are also used as the package dependencies through `pyproject.toml`,
so there is one runtime dependency list. Bump `localdeploy/__init__.py::__version__` and add a
`CHANGELOG.md` section together; a test enforces that they match.

The smoke test covers Python syntax, `config.example.json`, PowerShell parse checks, import-time API validation, and optional local HTTP routes if the API is already running. It does not require Ollama models to be pulled.

For the offline-egress guarantee:

```powershell
python scripts\egress_selftest.py
```

## Pull Request Expectations

- Do not add cloud inference SDKs or hosted inference defaults.
- Keep backend URLs localhost-only unless there is a deliberate security review.
- Keep `.env`, `config.json`, GGUF files, and model weights out of Git.
- Add or update docs when changing request fields, profiles, or safety behavior.
- Prefer clear validation errors over silent clamping unless `allow_clamp=true` is explicitly requested.

## Code Style

- Python should stay dependency-light and readable.
- PowerShell scripts should work on Windows 10 PowerShell.
- Avoid broad refactors unless they directly support the change.
- Keep documentation direct and avoid em dashes.

Release steps are in [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).
